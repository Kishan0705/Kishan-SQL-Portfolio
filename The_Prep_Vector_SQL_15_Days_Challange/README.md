### üìñ About This Challenge

This repository showcases my solutions for the **PrepVector 15-Day SQL Challenge**, a hands-on learning series designed to strengthen SQL problem-solving skills through real-world scenarios.

Over the course of **15 days**, I tackled diverse SQL challenges ranging from **basic aggregations** to **advanced analytical queries** involving:

- **CTEs and Subqueries**
- **Window Functions (ROW_NUMBER, LAG, LAST_VALUE)**
- **Joins and Self-Joins**
- **Data Transformation and Pivoting**
- **Performance Optimization Techniques**

Each challenge focuses on a unique business problem, such as calculating **click-through rates**, analyzing **monthly revenue growth**, detecting **duplicate transactions**, and more.  
The goal was not just to write queries, but to **think critically**, break down complex problems, and apply the right SQL concepts effectively.
