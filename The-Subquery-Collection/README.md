## Usage of NOT EXISTS and NOT IN

**Scenario:**
**You‚Äôre working for a Logistics Company, and you‚Äôre tasked to analyze delivery performance. Your company has the following tables:**

**Task:**
**Write a query to find Driver Names in regions where all deliveries assigned to drivers have a status of 'Delivered'.**

```sql

SELECT 
    d.DriverName,
    d.RegionID
FROM 
    Drivers d
WHERE 
    NOT EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 
        FROM Deliveries dil
        WHERE 
            dil.DriverID = d.DriverID 
            AND dil.Status <> 'Delivered'
    );


```


**Question: Identify Customers with No Orders in the Last 6 Months**


```sql

SELECT 
    c.CustomerName 
FROM 
    Customers c
JOIN 
    Orders o ON c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID 
WHERE 
    NOT EXISTS (
        SELECT 1
        FROM Orders o1
        WHERE 
            o1.CustomerID = c.CustomerID 
            AND o1.OrderDate >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '6 months'
    );


```

**Q : Find the names of customers who have not placed any orders in the last 3 months.**

```sql
SELECT 
    c.CustomerName 
FROM 
    Customers c 
WHERE 
    NOT EXISTS ( 
        SELECT 1 
        FROM Orders o1
        WHERE o1.CustomerID = c.CustomerID 
        AND o1.OrderDate >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '3 months'
    );

```

**Find the names of employees who have never supervised anyone.**

```sql
SELECT 
    e.EmployeeName 
FROM 
    Employees e 
WHERE 
    e.EmployeeID NOT IN (
        SELECT DISTINCT ManagerID 
        FROM Employees 
        WHERE ManagerID IS NOT NULL
    );

```

**Find the names of employees who are not managing anyone and are not assigned to any pending projects.**
```sql
SELECT 
    e.EmployeeName
FROM 
    Employees e 
JOIN 
    Projects p ON e.EmployeeID = p.EmployeeID 
WHERE 
    NOT EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 
        FROM Projects p1
        WHERE 
            p1.EmployeeID = e.EmployeeID 
            AND p1.Status = 'Completed'
    )
    AND e.ManagerID IS NULL;
